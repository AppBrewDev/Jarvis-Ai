# What is Jarvis-Ai?
Jarvis-AI is an intelligent system, that will perceive and respond to the world around them.

This is the first step, but the goal is to reach an intelligent system that will be able, to interact with the world around it, and perform task, or take action to reach its goal, and make decisions, gain experience and learn from it.

# Steps to reach our goal

Step 1: Problem Identification.
What is this system is going to do? what benefits the system will be able to achieve.

Step 2: Get the Required Data.
After identifying the problem, data need to be collected, cleaned, type of data, is, if feature engineering is required.

Step 3: Create a Model
Depending on the data we are working on there are different, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms that we can work with, the final model will depend on step 4 which is traing the model and get the best results.

Step 4: Training the models
Training the model is a very important step, several models will be trained, in order to get the lowest error or highest accuracy, but overfitting must be checked, by validating the model and comapare the results with the trained model.

Step 5: Test the Model
Testing the model and check the error or accuracy, then optimize the model, if the results are not as expected.
